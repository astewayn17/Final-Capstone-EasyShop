Bugs
    ProductsController Class (minor)
        Bug 1 - Users say the search is returning incorrect results - fix the search logic
        Bug 2 - Some products seem to be duplicated - ex: a laptop listed 3 times looks to be the same
                except for some light differences. It seems that each time the laptop was updated, it 
                instead created two more. This needs to be fixed to admins can safely update products.
    CategoriesController Class (major) (Only ADMIN role alllowed to modify)
        Implement the code and add the correct annotations: use the ProductsController for reference.
    Unit Tests - To verify the bugs are fixed and the Categories/ProductsController classes function.
    Postman - To verify the API are functional. 

New Features (Optional)
    1. Shopping Cart
        Database already has shopping cart table.
        Should only be available to users that are logged in.
        When an item gets added, it should remain for that user when they log back in.
        ShoppingCartController class is already added but need to add methods for REST actions.
        Look at PDF for the specific REST method requirements.
    2. User Profile
        When a user registers for an account, a profile is created in the profile table. 
        They should be able to view and update the profile.
        Need to create a ProfileController class and add Get and Put methods.
        Profile/MySqlProfileDao exist - used to create a profile when a user registers.
        Need to update the DAO to add getByUserId and update methods.
    3. Checkout
        Will need significant planning since no code for this is provided.
        Create an OrdersController class that has a post REST method.
            - The POST method does not require a body. The method should retrieve
              the current user's shopping cart. It should create and insert a new 
              Order into the orders table, thenc reate an OrderLineItem for each 
              shopping cart item and add each item to the database. 
        Once the order is created, the shopping cart should be cleared.
